# Chapter 5: Token Economics

## The Mathematics of Abundance

Traditional tokenomics operates on scarcity logic: limited supply, deflationary mechanics, holder supremacy. This creates wealth for early adopters but kills network effects. RawJade inverts this entirely. We've created an economy of abundance that paradoxically increases value.

300 billion RawDE tokens might seem excessive until you consider our ambition: enabling 5 billion people to participate meaningfully in the cultural economy. That's 60 tokens per person—enough to explore, create, and appreciate without artificial constraints.

## Distribution Architecture

### The 210 Billion Cold Pool: Democracy Through Design

70% of all tokens sleep in Cold Pools, waiting. Not for arbitrary vesting schedules or whale accumulation, but for genuine cultural activity to awaken them. Each of 21 groups controls 10 billion RawDE—not as treasury to spend but as potential energy to release.

This isn't communist central planning or capitalist concentration. It's something new: distributed potential energy that becomes kinetic only through collective cultural creation. No single entity—not even RawJade Limited—can arbitrarily release these tokens. Only the algorithm responds to the algorithm: FSC metrics trigger releases automatically, transparently, immutably.

### The 30 Billion Partner Allocation: Aligning Immortal Interests

- Founding team: 12 billion (4%)
- Foundation: 6 billion (2%)
- Dongseok Preservation: 6 billion (2%)
- Seed investors: 6 billion (2%)

These aren't employee stock options or VC preferences. They're alignment mechanisms for multi-generational thinking. The founding team's tokens vest over 10 years—the entire DAO transition period. They can't exit before the community owns everything.

### The Remaining 60 Billion: Infrastructure for Infinity

- Development/Operations: 15 billion (5%)
- RawMine Infrastructure: 21 billion (7%)
- Reserve/Community: 24 billion (8%)

Notice what's missing: marketing budgets, exchange listing fees, influencer allocations. When you're building something genuinely valuable, you don't need to pay people to pay attention.

## Value Mechanics

### The Hybrid Stability Model

RawDE isn't a stablecoin—it's better. Stablecoins peg to fiat currency, inheriting inflation and monetary policy. RawDE anchors to preserved jade while floating on network growth.

**RawDE Value = Jade Base Value × (1 + (Global STI - 1.0) × Network Completion × 10)**

Let's break this down:
- **Jade Base Value**: Starts at $10, adjusted annually by independent valuation
- **Global STI**: Weighted average trust index across all Stations
- **Network Completion**: Percentage of 315 target Stations operational

At launch (5 Stations, STI 1.0): RawDE = $10
At scale (315 Stations, STI 2.0): RawDE = $10 × (1 + 1.0 × 1.0 × 10) = $110

This isn't speculation—it's network effect quantified.

### Original Usage Fee: The Perpetual Endowment

When a Raw30 Miner pays 20 RawDE to use a Raw, the distribution is profound:
- 4 RawDE (20%) to Raw Miner: Direct reward for cultural preservation
- 16 RawDE (80%) to Local Cold Pool: Strengthening regional economy

This creates geographic arbitrage opportunities. If Seoul's creators heavily use Tokyo's Raws, value flows from Korea to Japan. This isn't trade deficit—it's cultural current, incentivizing each region to digitize its most compelling heritage.

## Circulation Dynamics

### The 60% Transformation: Advertising Becomes Art

Every month, a miracle occurs. Advertising dollars—the pollution of attention economy—transform into cultural creation tokens. Not through some arbitrary exchange rate but through profound alchemy:

1. First Comers pay local currency for advertising
2. 60% converts to RawDE at market rate
3. FSC multiplier rewards cultural health
4. Tokens flow to creators and appreciators

This isn't a tax or fee—it's metamorphosis. The same money that usually funds surveillance capitalism instead enables artistic expression.

Consider the scale: 25,000 First Comers × $240 monthly average = $6 million monthly ad spend. 60% conversion = $3.6 million monthly buy pressure. Not from speculators but from actual businesses with actual customers creating actual value.

### The 6% Reserve Pool: Mutual Insurance for All

Here's the revolutionary insight: we take 0% from creators but 6% from advertising revenue for our Reserve Pool. This creates a self-sustaining mutual insurance system:

**Reserve Pool Allocation:**
- **50% Immediate Liquidity**: Available for ecosystem emergencies
- **30% Strategic Staking**: Earning 6% APY through validator operations
- **20% Infrastructure Investment**: Building RawMines and technology

At maturity (315 cities), this generates:
- Annual Reserve contribution: $13.61M
- Staking returns (6% APY): Growing annually
- 10-year cumulative Reserve: $88M+

This isn't extracted value—it's pooled security. Like a mutual insurance company owned by its members, the Reserve Pool protects everyone while belonging to everyone.
