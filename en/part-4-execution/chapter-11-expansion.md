# Chapter 11: Global Expansion

## The 21 Group Strategy: Nature, Not Nurture

Silicon Valley scales through force: Burn money, buy users, dominate markets. We scale through nature: Plant seeds, nurture growth, harvest sustainably.

The 21 groups aren't arbitrary divisions—they're cultural watersheds. Each represents a distinct combination of:
- **Economic model** (developed/emerging)
- **Digital maturity** (cashless/transitioning)
- **Cultural context** (individualist/collectivist)
- **Regulatory environment** (crypto-friendly/restricted)
- **Language family** (alphabetic/ideographic/mixed)

This diversity isn't a challenge—it's the point. A system that works in both Stockholm and São Paulo, Tokyo and Cairo, isn't just robust—it's antifragile.

## Natural Selection Through Smart Contracts

Traditional expansion: Headquarters decides, managers execute, markets respond (or don't).

RawJade expansion: Markets demonstrate readiness, smart contracts recognize achievement, expansion happens automatically.

The mechanism is elegant:

1. **Station achieves 6 criteria** (300 First Comers, $400K monthly revenue, 50K MAU, $50K profit, 300 Raws, FSC >1.2)
2. **Smart contract verifies** (30 days continuous achievement)
3. **Cold Pool divides** (50% to new Station)
4. **Territory allocated** (based on geographic/demographic logic)
5. **New Station initialized** (inherits group characteristics)

No committees. No politics. No favoritism. Just demonstrated success creating documented expansion.

Example: Seoul Station achieves criteria in March 2028. Smart contract automatically authorizes Busan Station. Seoul keeps 5 billion RawDE, Busan receives 5 billion. Both now compete to reach criteria first for next expansion (Incheon? Daegu?). Competition creates excellence.

## RawMine Placement Strategy: Cultural Mining, Not Crypto Mining

84 RawMines are Cultural Mining Facilities where physical heritage transforms into digital wealth. They follow three placement principles:

**1. Cultural Density**
Museums, galleries, private collections concentrate in specific cities. RawMines follow culture, not just commerce.
- Beijing/Shanghai: 5,000 years of Chinese civilization
- Cairo: Pharaonic through Islamic treasures
- London: Global collections (complicated but rich)
- New York: Global art market center
- Seoul: Contemporary Asian cultural hub

**2. Digitization Excellence**
Some cities have advanced infrastructure for cultural preservation:
- Tokyo: Precision technology and craftsmanship
- Singapore: Southeast Asian cultural crossroads
- Mumbai: Bollywood and traditional arts fusion
- Paris: Fashion and fine arts expertise
- São Paulo: Latin American creative capital

**3. Strategic Distribution**
RawMines create regional hubs for cultural mining:
- 21 primary cities: 2-4 RawMines each
- 63 secondary cities: 1 RawMine each
- Total: 84 facilities globally

Each RawMine processes 1,000+ artifacts annually, extracting 20-30 Raws per piece. That's 20,000-30,000 new Raws per facility per year, or 1.68-2.52 million Raws across the network—the world's largest open cultural database.

## Geographic Distribution: The Four Megas

### Mega A: Northeast Asia (3 groups)
- A-1 Korea: Tech-forward, culturally cohesive
- A-2 Japan: Quality-obsessed, tradition-respecting
- A-3 Greater China: Scale-oriented, entrepreneurial

Combined potential: 1.8 billion people, $20 trillion GDP, highest digital payment penetration globally.

First Comer targets:
- Group First Comers: 900 (3 groups × 300)
- General First Comers: ~2,800
- Total: ~3,700

### Mega B: Asia-Pacific (7 groups)
- B-1 India: Young, mobile-first, English-speaking
- B-2 Maritime SEA: Island nations, trade heritage
- B-3 Mainland SEA: Buddhist influence, emerging digital
- B-4 South Asia: Islamic banking compatible
- B-5 Central Asia: Silk Road revival
- B-6 Eastern Europe: Post-Soviet transformation
- B-7 Oceania: Western values, Asian proximity

Combined potential: 2.5 billion people, vast cultural diversity, rapid digital adoption.

First Comer targets:
- Group First Comers: 2,100 (7 groups × 300)
- General First Comers: ~6,500
- Total: ~8,600

### Mega C: The West (5 groups)
- C-1 Western Europe: Regulatory clarity, cultural appetite
- C-2 Central Europe: Technical excellence, lower costs
- C-3 Southern Europe: Artistic heritage, lifestyle focus
- C-4 Northern Europe: Trust societies, innovation leaders
- C-5 North America: Scale markets, venture mindset

Combined potential: 1 billion people, $40 trillion GDP, mature but transformable markets.

First Comer targets:
- Group First Comers: 1,500 (5 groups × 300)
- General First Comers: ~4,700
- Total: ~6,200

### Mega D: Emerging Frontiers (6 groups)
- D-1 Central America/Caribbean: Remittance economy
- D-2 Northern South America: Resource rich, culturally vibrant
- D-3 Southern South America: European influence, educated
- D-4 Middle East: Sovereign wealth, modernization drive
- D-5 North Africa: Young population, Mediterranean connection
- D-6 Sub-Saharan Africa: Mobile leapfrogging, Ubuntu philosophy

Combined potential: 1.7 billion people, fastest growth rates, innovation through necessity.

First Comer targets:
- Group First Comers: 1,800 (6 groups × 300)
- General First Comers: ~5,000
- Total: ~6,800

**Total First Comer Network:**
- **Group First Comers**: 6,300 (21 groups × 300)
- **General First Comers**: ~18,700
- **Total First Comers**: ~25,000

## 315 Cities by 2036: The Fractal Growth

Year 1 (2027): 5 cities
Year 2 (2028): 15 cities (3x)
Year 3 (2029): 35 cities (2.3x)
Year 4 (2030): 70 cities (2x)
Year 5 (2031): 120 cities (1.7x)
Year 6 (2032): 180 cities (1.5x)
Year 7 (2033): 240 cities (1.3x)
Year 8 (2034): 280 cities (1.2x)
Year 9 (2035): 310 cities (1.1x)
Year 10 (2036): 315 cities (complete)

Notice the deceleration? That's intentional. Early growth is explosive but shallow. Later growth is measured but deep. By Year 10, we're not adding cities—we're perfecting civilizations.

Each city's journey:
- **Year 0-1**: Infrastructure (First Comers, basic adoption)
- **Year 1-2**: Participation (Jade Miners emerge)
- **Year 2-3**: Creation (Raw30 Miners proliferate)
- **Year 3-4**: Curation (Value Completers mature)
- **Year 4-5**: Governance (Local culture established)

By 2036, Seoul (our first city) will have 10 years of cultural development. It won't just be using RawJade—it will BE RawJade. The system and the city will be inseparable.
