# Executive Summary

**The Creator Economy Has Failed. We're Building What Comes Next.**

## The $1 Trillion Opportunity Hidden in Plain Sight

Every day, 50 million creators upload content, chase algorithms, and dream of success. Only 150,000 make a living. That's a 99.7% failure rate. The creator economy hasn't democratized opportunity—it's created a new digital feudalism where platforms extract 30-50% from the lucky few while the rest work for free.

Meanwhile, $100 trillion worth of cultural artifacts sit locked in vaults, invisible to 5 billion people. AI learns from data representing only 5% of humanity. And everywhere, the polycrisis deepens: economic inequality, cultural erasure, technological displacement.

**RawJade doesn't fix the creator economy. We replace it with the participant economy.**

## From Polycrisis to Polytunity: A Civilizational Shift

Professor Yuen Yuen Ang of Johns Hopkins coined a transformative concept: polycrisis can become polytunity—multiple crises creating multiple opportunities. RawJade embodies this transformation through four paradigm shifts:

### 1. Preservation Creates More Value Than Extraction

We own mining rights to 300,000 tons of jade in Gangwon Province, Korea—worth $3 trillion if extracted. Instead of mining it, we're preserving it forever underground. This physical jade becomes eternal collateral for 300 billion RawDE tokens. One rock, untouched, creates infinite digital value.

### 2. Zero Platform Fees—Forever

Every platform takes their cut: YouTube 45%, Instagram 45%, OnlyFans 20%. RawJade takes 0%. Creators keep 100% of their revenue. We don't profit from extraction; we profit from ecosystem growth. When creators succeed, we succeed. No hidden fees, no future changes—0% forever, guaranteed by smart contract.

### 3. Appreciation Becomes Creation

In RawJade, you don't need talent to create value. Every view earns rewards. Every rating builds reputation. Every moment of cultural engagement generates economic value. Through our FSC (FlowStation Coefficient) system, communities with more appreciation than creation receive higher liquidity rewards. The 99.7% who "just watch" become essential economic actors.

### 4. Cultural Mining, Not Crypto Mining

While others chase cryptocurrency, we mine culture. Our 84 RawMines are cultural mining facilities where physical artifacts transform into digital Raw. Each artifact yields 20-30 digital Raws through multi-layer extraction. This isn't blockchain mining—it's cultural archaeology for the digital age.
