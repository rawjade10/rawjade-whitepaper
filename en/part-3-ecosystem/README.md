# Part III: The Ecosystem

This section explores the human elements and technical systems that make RawJade's participant economy possible.

## Chapters

7. [Five Archetypes](./chapter-7-archetypes.md) - The five ways everyone participates in value creation
8. [Technology Infrastructure](./chapter-8-technology.md) - The technical foundation beyond blockchain hype
9. [Governance Evolution](./chapter-9-governance.md) - The 10-year journey from company to DAO

## The Five Archetypes

1. **First Comers** - 25,000 pioneer merchants transforming commerce into culture
2. **Raw Miners** - Heritage holders earning from cultural preservation
3. **Raw30 Miners** - AI collaborators turning imagination into income
4. **Jade Miners** - Everyday explorers discovering treasures through shopping
5. **Value Completers** - Appreciators whose engagement creates economic value

## Technology Stack

- **Blockchain**: Solana for utility, not philosophy
- **Storage**: Four-layer fortress (Blockchain + IPFS + Arweave + CDN)
- **AI**: GPT-4 as teacher through 30-conversation protocol
- **Cultural Mining**: 20-30 Raws extracted from each artifact
- **FlowPay**: Zero-friction jade fragment distribution

## Governance Timeline

Stage | Years | Company Control | Community Control
---|---|---|---
Springs | 2027-2029 | 100% | 0% (Advisory)
Stream | 2029-2031 | 80% | 20%
River | 2031-2033 | 50% | 50%
Ocean | 2033-2035 | 10% | 90%
Earth | 2035+ | 0% | 100% (DAO)

## Key Innovation

**Everyone Creates Value**: Unlike the creator economy where 99.7% fail, the participant economy recognizes that every action—creating, collecting, viewing, rating, sharing—generates economic value worthy of reward.

## The Paradigm Shift

From | To
---|---
Binary roles (creator/consumer) | Fluid participation
Talent requirement | Imagination suffices
Extraction economy | Appreciation economy
Platform ownership | Community governance
Winner-take-all | Everyone wins
