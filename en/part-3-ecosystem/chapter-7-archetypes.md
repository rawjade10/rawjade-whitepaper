# Chapter 7: Five Archetypes

## The Cast of a New Economic Theater

Every economy is ultimately about people. Not GDP or market caps or token prices, but human beings creating, exchanging, and appreciating value. RawJade's ecosystem recognizes five archetypal roles—not job titles or class distinctions, but modes of participation that anyone can embody, simultaneously or sequentially, as they journey through our cultural economy.

These aren't rigid categories. A Seoul cafe owner might be a First Comer by day, a Raw30 Miner by night, and a Value Completer during lunch breaks. A Tokyo grandmother might start as a Jade Miner collecting fragments, evolve into a Raw Miner by contributing her family's heirloom ceramics, and eventually become a Master-level Value Completer whose taste influences thousands.

This fluidity is the point. The creator economy forced people into binary roles: creator or consumer, producer or audience, talent or fan. We recognize that every human contains multitudes.

## First Comers: The 25,000 Pioneers

### The Two Tiers of Revolutionary Merchants

RawJade's First Comers aren't just early adopters—they're the foundation stones of a new economy. These 25,000 merchants worldwide transform their businesses from transaction points into cultural nodes.

**Group First Comers: The 6,300 Elite**

In the 21 founding cities—Seoul, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore, Bangkok, and 16 others—exactly 300 merchants per city can achieve Group First Comer status. These 6,300 pioneers (21 cities × 300 merchants) represent the absolute vanguard of the participant economy.

Wang runs a bubble tea shop in Singapore's Tiong Bahru district. By committing $7,200 upfront (36 months × $200), he secured one of Singapore's 300 Group First Comer positions. His benefits are permanent and profound:
- **19% drop rate**: Nearly 1 in 5 transactions drops jade fragments
- **720,000 RawDE tokens**: Immediate allocation worth $7.2M at launch
- **Permanent recognition**: Forever listed as a founding pioneer
- **Priority territory**: Exclusive rights in his district
- **Master FlowID**: Highest governance weight from day one

**General First Comers: The ~19,000 Network**

Beyond the 21 group cities, approximately 19,000 merchants across 294 cities will become General First Comers. While they don't receive the same benefits as Group First Comers, their advantages remain significant:
- **8% drop rate**: Still 60% higher than standard merchants
- **Monthly flexibility**: $200/month, no long-term commitment required
- **Regional priority**: First access to new features and programs
- **Carved FlowID**: Enhanced voting rights and trust score
- **Network effects**: Part of the founding 25,000

### The Network Effect Multiplier

25,000 First Comers create compound benefits:
1. **Direct Impact**: Each serves 200+ customers daily = 5 million daily touchpoints
2. **Clustering Effect**: Customers visit multiple First Comers = 15 million interactions
3. **Social Proof**: Early adoption validates the system = accelerated growth
4. **Geographic Coverage**: 315 cities with established networks = global reach

### The Economics of First Coming

First Comers generate our primary revenue stream:
- **Group First Comers**: 6,300 × $2,400/year = $15.12M annually
- **General First Comers**: ~19,000 × $2,400/year = $45.6M annually
- **Total First Comer Revenue**: $60.72M annually (early stage)

## Raw Miners: The Heritage Holders

### From Hoarders to Heroes

Mrs. Chen inherited 47 pieces of Ming dynasty porcelain from her grandmother. For decades, they sat in climate-controlled storage, costing $500 monthly to maintain. She couldn't sell them (emotional attachment), couldn't display them (insurance costs), couldn't enjoy them (fear of damage). They were simultaneously priceless and worthless.

Then she became a Raw Miner.

Now her porcelains live in RawMine Shanghai, preserved at museum standards for free. Through our Cultural Mining process, each piece has been digitized into multiple Raws—not just photography but sophisticated multi-layer extraction:

**From a single porcelain vase, our Cultural Mining extracts:**
- Overall form and proportions (3-5 Raws)
- Individual figure details (5-8 Raws)
- Background patterns (4-6 Raws)
- Border designs (3-5 Raws)
- Color palette variations (2-3 Raws)
- Technique demonstrations (2-3 Raws)
- Historical context (1-2 Raws)
- **Total: 20-30 Raws from one artifact**

Her 47 pieces became 1,175 Raws. Monthly income from usage fees: $3,000-8,000. Storage savings: $500. Insurance savings: $2,000. Total monthly benefit: $5,500-10,500.

### The Cultural Mining Revolution

Traditional digitization creates one digital copy of one physical object. Our Cultural Mining process multiplies value exponentially:
1. **3D Scanning**: Complete volumetric capture
2. **AI Analysis**: Pattern recognition and element extraction
3. **Semantic Layering**: Meaning and symbolism identification
4. **Generative Preparation**: AI-readable format conversion
5. **Metadata Enrichment**: Historical and cultural context

## Raw30 Miners: The AI Collaborators

### Sarah's Journey: From Barista to Artist

Sarah serves coffee at a Melbourne First Comer cafe. She never went to art school, can't draw a straight line, barely passed high school art. But she has something more valuable: imagination and 30 conversations worth of patience.

Her first Raw30 took two weeks. She selected a Korean moon jar Raw, drawn to its simplicity. Her initial prompts were awkward: "Make it modern?" The AI responded with options, teaching her vocabulary she didn't know she needed. By conversation 10, she was using terms like "minimalist aesthetic" and "negative space."

By conversation 20, she'd found her direction: melding Korean ceramics with Aboriginal dot painting—two cultures meeting in digital space. The final 10 conversations refined details: color temperature, pattern density, compositional balance.

The result? "Dreamtime Moon," which has earned Sarah $1,200 monthly for six months. Not life-changing money, but life-affirming validation: She is an artist.

### The Pedagogy of 30

Why exactly 30 conversations? Our research revealed three distinct phases in human-AI creative collaboration:

**Conversations 1-10: Exploration**
- User learns AI capabilities
- AI learns user preferences
- Both establish common language
- Divergent thinking dominates

**Conversations 11-20: Convergence**
- Direction crystallizes
- Style emerges
- Unnecessary elements eliminated
- Vision clarifies

**Conversations 21-30: Refinement**
- Details perfected
- Consistency achieved
- Personal signature developed
- Mastery demonstrated

## Jade Miners: The Everyday Explorers

### The Gamification of Grocery Shopping

Kevin, a Bangkok office worker, never played mobile games or collected anything. But something about jade fragments captured him. Maybe it was the anticipation—will this coffee purchase drop a fragment? Maybe the collecting—four fragments down, one to go. Maybe the discovery—what Raw will these five fragments reveal?

Six months later, Kevin has:
- Collected 847 jade fragments
- Discovered 169 Raws
- Found 3 Legendary Raws (0.1% probability)
- Built a collection worth 4,200 RawDE ($42,000)

But Kevin doesn't see himself as an investor or collector. He's an explorer. Each day brings new routes through the city, seeking unvisited First Comers. Each fragment is a clue. Each Raw discovery, a small victory.

### The Drop Rate Hierarchy

The jade fragment system creates perfect incentive alignment:

**Standard Merchants** (5% drop rate):
- 1 in 20 chance per transaction
- Basic participation level

**General First Comers** (8% drop rate):
- 60% better odds than standard
- Rewards early adoption

**Group First Comers** (19% drop rate):
- Nearly 1 in 5 chance
- Premium destination status

## Value Completers: The Appreciation Economy

### The Revolutionary Act of Looking

In attention economy platforms, viewing is extraction. Your eyeballs generate ad revenue for platforms while you receive nothing except dopamine hits and anxiety. In RawJade, viewing is value creation—for yourself, the creator, and the entire ecosystem.

Maria, a nurse in São Paulo, spends her commute browsing Raw30 creations. She doesn't create—too tired after 12-hour shifts. But her careful viewing, rating, and commenting has earned her Polished FlowID status. Her appreciation literally has currency:
- Each view: +1 trust point
- Each rating: +2 trust points
- Each comment (20+ words): +3 trust points
- Daily engagement bonus: +5 trust points
- Monthly consistency bonus: +50 trust points

Her Polished status provides:
- 5% drop rate bonus at First Comers
- 1.5x governance voting weight
- Priority access to new Raw releases
- Invitation to exclusive cultural events

### The Ladder of Cultural Authority

Value Completers ascend through five levels of influence:

**Explorer (0-6 months)**: Discovering personal taste
**Critic (6-12 months)**: Developing authoritative voice
**Curator (1-2 years)**: Creating cultural context
**Influencer (2-3 years)**: Shaping ecosystem direction
**Tastemaker (3+ years)**: Defining cultural evolution

### The Economics of Appreciation

Traditional model: Viewers pay (subscriptions) or get exploited (ads).
RawJade model: Viewers invest (10 RawDE per Raw30) but gain:
- Cultural enrichment (access to global creativity)
- Social capital (FlowID reputation)
- Economic value (trust score benefits)
- Governance power (voting rights)
- Community belonging (shared discovery)

Current Value Completer metrics:
- Active appreciators: 47,329
- Average daily views: 3.7 per user
- Median trust score: 1,247 points
- Governance participants: 8,926
- Cultural influence index: Growing 23% monthly
