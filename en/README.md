# RawJade Whitepaper - English Version

## Executive Summary

**The Creator Economy Has Failed. We're Building What Comes Next.**

Every day, 50 million creators upload content, chase algorithms, and dream of success. Only 150,000 make a living. That's a 99.7% failure rate.

RawJade doesn't fix the creator economy. We replace it with the participant economy.
