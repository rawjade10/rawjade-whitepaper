## 🎯 Core Innovation

**The Creator Economy Has Failed. We're Building What Comes Next.**

- **99.7%** of creators fail to make a living
- **30-50%** platform fees extract value
- **0%** is what viewers earn for their attention

RawJade transforms this through:
- **0% platform fees forever**
- **6% Reserve Pool** for mutual success
- **300,000 tons** of preserved jade backing
- **Everyone creates value** through participation
