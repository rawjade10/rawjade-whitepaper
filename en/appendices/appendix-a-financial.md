## Revenue Architecture (v0.9H Revised)

### Four-Stream Sustainable Revenue Model

RawJade operates on a revolutionary four-stream revenue model that ensures sustainability without platform fees:

### Stream 1: First Comer Advertising Revenue

**Group First Comers (6,300 merchants):**
- 21 cities × 300 merchants = 6,300 total
- Investment: $7,200 per merchant (3-year prepayment)
- Monthly equivalent: $200/month
- Annual revenue: 6,300 × $2,400 = $15.12M
- Immediate token allocation: 720,000 RawDE per merchant

**General First Comers (~18,700 merchants):**
- 294 cities × ~64 average = 18,700 total
- Investment: $200/month (flexible)
- Annual revenue: 18,700 × $2,400 = $44.88M
- Monthly commitment with upgrade options

**Total First Comer Revenue Evolution:**
- Phase 1 (21 cities, 6,300 merchants): $15.12M annually
- Phase 2 (84 cities, 10,000 merchants): $24M annually
- Phase 3 (150 cities, 15,000 merchants): $36M annually
- Phase 4 (315 cities, 25,000 merchants): $60M annually

### Stream 2: The 6% Reserve Pool System

**Reserve Pool Contribution (6% of advertising revenue):**
- Year 1 (Phase 1): $15.12M × 6% = $907K
- Year 3 (Phase 2): $24M × 6% = $1.44M
- Year 5 (Phase 3): $36M × 6% = $2.16M
- Year 10 (Phase 4): $60M × 6% = $3.6M

**Reserve Pool Allocation:**
- 50% Immediate Liquidity: Crisis response and opportunities
- 30% Strategic Staking: 6% APY through validator operations
- 20% Infrastructure: Technology and expansion

**10-Year Reserve Pool Growth:**
- Direct contributions: $21.6M
- Staking compound returns (6% APY): $6.8M
- Validator operation profits: $15M
- Total 10-year Reserve: $43.4M

### Stream 3: Cultural Mining Operations

**Raw Usage Fees:**
- 20 RawDE per Raw usage
- Projected 1M uses Year 1, growing to 50M Year 10
- Revenue split: 20% to Raw Miner, 80% to Cold Pool

**Digitization Services:**
- Museum partnerships: $10K per collection
- Private collections: $5K per collection
- Target: 100 collections Year 1, 1,000 collections Year 10

**Projected Cultural Mining Revenue:**
- Year 1: $2M
- Year 3: $5M
- Year 5: $10M
- Year 10: $20M

### Stream 4: Validator Operations

**Solana Validator Staking:**
- Stake requirement: 50,000 SOL minimum
- Annual returns: 6-8% APY
- Operating costs: <$50K per validator
- Net profit: $500K-1M per validator annually

## Token Economics Deep Dive

### Supply Distribution (300 Billion RawDE)

| Category | Amount | Percentage | Purpose |
|----------|--------|------------|---------|
| Cold Pool (21 groups) | 210B | 70% | Liquidity based on FSC achievement |
| Founding Team | 12B | 4% | 10-year vesting, aligned with DAO transition |
| Foundation | 6B | 2% | Cultural preservation operations |
| Dongseok Preservation | 6B | 2% | Jade custody and maintenance |
| Seed Investors | 6B | 2% | Early capital providers |
| Development/Operations | 15B | 5% | Platform development |
| RawMine Infrastructure | 21B | 7% | Cultural Mining facilities |
| Reserve/Community | 24B | 8% | DAO treasury and emergencies |

### Value Mechanics Formula

RawDE Value = Jade Base Value × Network Multiplier

Where:
- Jade Base Value = $10 (annually adjusted)
- Network Multiplier = (1 + (Global STI - 1.0) × Network Completion × 10)

Projections:
- Launch (5 cities): $10
- Year 3 (50 cities): $16
- Year 5 (150 cities): $35
- Year 10 (315 cities): $110
