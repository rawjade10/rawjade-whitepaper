# Appendix E: FAQ

## General Questions

### Q: How is RawJade different from other creator platforms?

RawJade fundamentally reimagines the creator economy in five ways:
1. **Zero platform fees forever** - creators keep 100% of revenues
2. **6% Reserve Pool** - mutual insurance for all participants
3. **Appreciation creates value** - viewers earn by engaging
4. **Physical backing** - 300,000 tons of preserved jade
5. **Cultural Mining** - 20-30 Raws extracted per artifact

Traditional platforms extract 30-50% fees and only 0.3% of creators earn living wages. RawJade enables all participants to create value through our mutual success model.

### Q: Why preserve the jade instead of mining it?

Mining would yield $3 trillion once, benefiting a few. Preserving it creates eternal value for billions. The jade underground backs 300 billion RawDE tokens, providing permanent value without environmental destruction. This demonstrates our philosophy: creating value without extraction, sharing prosperity without depletion.

### Q: What is Cultural Mining?

Cultural Mining is our revolutionary process of extracting multiple digital Raws from single physical artifacts. Using advanced 3D scanning, AI pattern recognition, and semantic analysis, we extract 20-30 unique elements from each piece—patterns, figures, colors, techniques—each becoming a Raw that can inspire infinite creations.

### Q: How can you afford 0% platform fees?

Four sustainable revenue streams replace platform fees:
1. First Comer advertising fees ($60M at maturity)
2. 6% Reserve Pool (growing to $3.6M annually)
3. Cultural Mining services ($20M at maturity)
4. Validator operations ($2M annually)

By taking 6% of advertising revenue for mutual insurance while charging creators nothing, we create a sustainable model that benefits everyone.

## Investment Questions

### Q: Why only 10 investors at $300K each?

We want partners, not just capital. Ten investors create meaningful engagement without dilution of vision. Each investor gets personal attention, regular updates, and real influence. The $300K level ensures serious commitment while keeping the group exclusive.

### Q: What's the Reserve Pool and why does it matter?

The Reserve Pool is our mutual insurance system. 6% of all advertising revenue goes into a pool that:
- 50% provides immediate liquidity
- 30% generates returns through staking
- 20% funds infrastructure

Growing to $43M+ over 10 years, it protects against risks and funds opportunities without extracting from creators.

### Q: What happens if the revenue projections are wrong?

Even in our conservative scenario:
- 5,000 First Comers = $12M annual revenue
- Reserve Pool = $720K annually
- Still profitable and growing
- Jade backing maintains token value

The model works at any scale; larger scale just accelerates impact.

## Merchant Questions

### Q: What's the difference between Group and General First Comers?

**Group First Comers** (6,300 total):
- 21 founding cities only
- 300 positions per city
- $7,200 prepayment (3 years)
- 19% drop rate (highest)
- 720,000 RawDE immediate
- Permanent founding status

**General First Comers** (~18,700 total):
- 294 additional cities
- Unlimited per city
- $200/month (flexible)
- 8% drop rate (premium)
- Monthly RawDE accumulation
- Regional pioneer status

### Q: How does "20 lunch meals" pricing work?

This intuitive model automatically adjusts for local economics:
- Seoul ($10 lunch): $200/month
- Mumbai ($3 lunch): $60/month
- New York ($15 lunch): $300/month

Equal burden regardless of location while remaining simple to understand.

### Q: Can I transfer my First Comer status?

Yes, First Comer positions are transferable assets. As drop rates decrease for new merchants and the ecosystem grows, these positions will likely appreciate in value.

## Creator Questions

### Q: Do I need artistic skills to create Raw30s?

No! The 30-conversation protocol with AI means you only need imagination. Can you describe what you want? Can you make choices? Can you refine ideas? Then you can create. The AI handles execution while you provide vision.

### Q: How much can I earn as a Raw30 creator?

With 0% platform fees:
- 10 daily views = $100/month
- 100 daily views = $1,000/month
- 1,000 daily views = $10,000/month

Plus initial creation reward of 10 RawDE profit per Raw30.

### Q: What exactly are the 30 conversations?

A structured creative dialogue:
- Conversations 1-10: Exploration (discovering possibilities)
- Conversations 11-20: Refinement (focusing direction)
- Conversations 21-30: Perfection (polishing details)

By conversation 30, you've created something uniquely yours.

## Technical Questions

### Q: What exactly are RawMines?

RawMines are Cultural Mining Facilities—not cryptocurrency mining farms. Each facility:
- Preserves artifacts in museum conditions
- Digitizes collections using advanced technology
- Extracts 20-30 Raws per artifact
- Generates revenue through usage fees
- Creates the world's largest cultural database

### Q: How does the 6% Reserve Pool system work?

Every month, 6% of advertising revenue automatically flows to the Reserve Pool:
- No manual intervention required
- Smart contract automated
- Transparent on blockchain
- Compounds through staking
- Protects entire ecosystem

### Q: What about environmental impact?

Unlike energy-intensive crypto mining:
- We run efficient validators (minimal energy)
- RawMines preserve culture (not extracting resources)
- Digital distribution reduces physical transport
- Jade remains underground (zero extraction)
- Net positive environmental impact

## Participation Questions

### Q: How do I start without investment?

Create a free FlowID and:
1. View Raw30s (earn trust points)
2. Rate and comment (build reputation)
3. Discover jade fragments (shopping normally)
4. Create Raw30s (10 RawDE profit each)
5. Join community discussions

### Q: What are FlowID grades?

Five levels of participation:
- **Raw** (0-6 months): Learning phase
- **Carved** (6-12 months): Active participant
- **Polished** (1-2 years): Established contributor
- **Jade** (2-3 years): Community leader
- **Master** (3+ years): Ecosystem elder

Each grade increases drop rates, voting weight, and privileges.

### Q: Can I participate from any country?

Yes! RawJade is global from day one. Start with Hong Kong Station as a preliminary global citizen, then join your local Station when it launches. The platform supports 50+ languages.

## Risk Questions

### Q: What if governments ban RawJade?

We have multiple defense layers:
- Multi-jurisdiction structure
- Adaptive architecture (Flow Points for restricted regions)
- Utility token classification
- Cultural preservation emphasis
- Community support

Even if banned in one country, the network continues globally.

### Q: What if the technology fails?

Redundancy at every level:
- Multiple blockchain options (not just Solana)
- Four-layer storage (Blockchain + IPFS + Arweave + CDN)
- Multiple AI providers
- Distributed infrastructure
- Regular backups and audits

### Q: What if competitors copy the model?

Our moat is unreplicable:
- 300,000 tons of jade (only one deposit)
- 1,300-piece porcelain collection (31 years to build)
- 25,000 First Comers (multi-year contracts)
- 0% fee structure (they can't go lower)
- Community loyalty (first-mover advantage)

## Future Questions

### Q: When does the DAO transition happen?

10-year progressive transition:
- 2027-2029: Company 100%, Community 0%
- 2029-2031: Company 80%, Community 20%
- 2031-2033: Company 50%, Community 50%
- 2033-2035: Company 10%, Community 90%
- 2035+: Company 0%, Community 100%

### Q: Will platform fees always be 0%?

Yes, guaranteed by smart contract. This is irreversible, even by the future DAO. It's a constitutional principle that requires 90% approval to change—practically impossible.

### Q: What's the ultimate vision?

5 billion people participating in the cultural economy, where everyone creates value through creation, collection, or appreciation. A world where culture is preserved while transforming, where platforms serve rather than extract, where the 99.7% become the 100%.
