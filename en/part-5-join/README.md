## The Bottom Line

This is not just an investment opportunity or a business platform. This is a civilizational choice.

Will you perpetuate the creator economy that fails 99.7%? Or will you help build the participant economy where everyone creates value?

Will you accept platforms extracting 30-50%? Or will you support 0% fees forever?

Will you watch culture disappear into private vaults? Or will you help preserve and share it globally?

The choice is yours. The moment is now. The future is waiting.

**Welcome to RawJade.**
**Welcome to the participant economy.**
**Welcome to the revolution.**
